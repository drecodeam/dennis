### INTRODUCTION
Dennis is still in very alpha stage and is being actively developed right now.

### GETTING STARTED
Dennis is based on Assemble Grunt plugin, so basically all the magic happens in the grunt file.

To start you need to [Fork the repo](https://github.com/drecodeam/dennis#fork-destination-box) or you can clone it

```git clone git@github.com:drecodeam/dennis.git```


Like all Grunt projects, all you have to do to start working on is run npm install.

```npm install```

### Adding website settings
All the website settings are saved in the ***src/bonnet/data/config.json*** file.

```
{
    "websiteTitle" : "dennis"
}
```
