You don't vote for kings. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. What do you mean?

## Blue. No, yel…

Bring her forward! Burn her anyway! Camelot!

*   We want a shrubbery!!
*   Well, I got better.
*   I dunno. Must be a king.
*   The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

### How do you know she is a witch?

Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, we did do the nose. Oh, ow! I am your king.

### How do you know she is a witch?

Be quiet! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

1.  No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.
2.  Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!
3.  Well, I didn't vote for you.
4.  Well, I didn't vote for you.

### Sets The Cinema Back 900 Years!

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I didn't vote for you. A newt?

### Blue. No, yel…

You don't vote for kings. …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? And the hat. She's a witch!

…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch! Shut up! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.

Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Bring her forward!

He hasn't got shit all over him. Well, I got better. Oh, ow! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone!

>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, what do you want? We want a shrubbery!! Well, I didn't vote for you. But you are dressed as one…

Oh, ow! What a strange person. Well, she turned me into a newt. Bring her forward! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! We want a shrubbery!!

### You don't vote for kings.

She looks like one. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. The nose?

Now, look here, my good man. Well, she turned me into a newt. Bloody Peasant!

>He hasn't got shit all over him. Burn her anyway! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!

No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. But you are dressed as one… Well, how'd you become king, then? Well, I got better.

Well, what do you want? Be quiet! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical!

Be quiet! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. A newt? How do you know she is a witch? Shut up! Will you shut up?! Be quiet!
