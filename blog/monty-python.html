<p>Bring her forward! Burn her anyway! Camelot!</p>

<p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, we did do the nose. Oh, ow! I am your king.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-know-she-is-a-witch-">How do you know she is a witch?</h3>
<p>Be quiet! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>

<p>&#x2026;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She&apos;s a witch! Shut up! We shall say &apos;Ni&apos; again to you, if you do not appease us.</p>

<p>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, what do you want? We want a shrubbery!! Well, I didn&apos;t vote for you. But you are dressed as one&#x2026;</p>
