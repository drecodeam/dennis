<p>Bring her forward! Burn her anyway! Camelot!</p>

<li>We want a shrubbery!!</li>
<li>Well, I got better.</li>
<li>I dunno. Must be a king.</li>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li>

<h3 id="how-do-you-know-she-is-a-witch-">How do you know she is a witch?</h3>
<p>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, we did do the nose. Oh, ow! I am your king.</p>

<p>Be quiet! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>

<li>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#39;s got a wart.</li>
<li>Well, Mercia&#39;s a temperate zone!</li>
<li>Well, I didn&#39;t vote for you.</li>

<p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Well, I didn&#39;t vote for you. A newt?</p>

<p>…Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Why do you think that she is a witch? And the hat. She&#39;s a witch! Shut up! We shall say &#39;Ni&#39; again to you, if you do not appease us.</p>
<p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Bring her forward!</p>
<p>He hasn&#39;t got shit all over him. Well, I got better. Oh, ow! You can&#39;t expect to wield supreme power just &#39;cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Well, Mercia&#39;s a temperate zone!</p>

<p>Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Well, what do you want? We want a shrubbery!! Well, I didn&#39;t vote for you. But you are dressed as one…</p>
