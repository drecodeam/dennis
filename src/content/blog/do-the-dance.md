Cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot.

i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave.

i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd.

>I once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. well, what is it today? more spelunking? you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.

rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time.

That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you.
